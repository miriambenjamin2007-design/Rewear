### Project Description
Rewear is a sustainable online thrift and smart wardrobe platform that helps users digitize their closet, optimize outfit combinations, detect redundant purchases, and reduce fashion overconsumption. It combines AI-based wardrobe analysis with a circular thrift marketplace to promote mindful consumption.

### The Problem statement
The fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to carbon emissions and textile waste. A significant percentage of purchased clothing goes unworn, while users frequently rebuy similar items due to lack of wardrobe awareness. Existing thrift platforms focus only on resale but do not address overconsumption at the decision-making stage.
There is a need for a system that reduces redundant purchases, increases garment utilization, and promotes sustainable fashion behavior.

### The Solution
Rewear introduces a digital wardrobe intelligence system integrated with a sustainable thrift marketplace.
Our platform:
Allows users to upload wardrobe images and digitize clothing items.
Uses classification logic to detect category, color, and redundancy.
Generates optimized outfit combinations to increase wear-per-item ratio.
Suggests donation or resale for underused garments.
Provides sustainability metrics such as estimated CO₂ savings and water savings.
Intervenes before purchase by alerting users when similar items already exist in their closet.
Instead of encouraging more shopping, Rewear promotes intentional and optimized consumption.

## Features

List the key features of your project:
1️. Digital Wardrobe Upload & Classification
Users can upload photos of their wardrobe.
The system classifies items by:
Category (tops, bottoms, dresses, etc.)
Color
Type
This converts a physical closet into structured digital data.
2️. AI-Based Outfit Generator
The platform suggests optimized outfit combinations from existing clothes based on:
Color harmony
Occasion
Item compatibility
This increases garment utilization and reduces “nothing to wear” purchases.
3️.Redundancy Detection & Keep/Discard Suggestions
The system identifies:
Duplicate or similar items
Underused clothes
It then suggests:
Keep
Donate
Resell
This reduces wardrobe clutter and fashion waste.
4️.Sustainable Thrift Marketplace Integration
Users can resell underused items through the platform’s thrift marketplace.
Features include:
Circular fashion model
Extended garment lifecycle
Estimated carbon savings tracking

👗 1. Thrift Marketplace

Users can:
Upload second-hand clothing items
Add details like size, category, condition, and price
Browse and filter products
Purchase items securely
This encourages reuse of clothing and reduces fast-fashion waste.

💖 2. Personality-Based Styling

ReWear includes a fun and interactive style quiz that identifies the user’s fashion personality (e.g., Minimalist, Cottagecore, Streetwear).
Based on quiz results, the system recommends thrift items that match their aesthetic.
This makes thrift shopping personalized and engaging.

🌍 3. Sustainability Impact Tracking

Every purchase contributes to:
Reduced textile waste
Lower carbon footprint
Water conservation
Users can view their sustainability score and track their positive environmental impact through a dashboard.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:**  GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT

Purpose:

Generated boilerplate React components for product listing and upload forms
Assisted in designing REST API endpoints for thrift listings and user authentication
Helped structure MongoDB schemas (Users, Products, Orders)
Suggested logic for personality-based styling quiz recommendations
Optimized backend route structure and middleware setup
Helped draft sustainability score calculation logic
Documentation writing and README formatting

Key Prompts Used:

“Create a REST API endpoint for thrift product upload using Node.js and Express”
“Design a MongoDB schema for a second-hand clothing marketplace”
“Create a personality-based quiz logic for styling recommendations”
“How to implement JWT authentication in a MERN stack project”
“Suggest a sustainability impact calculator for reused clothing”
“Optimize this product filtering logic for better performance”
“Create a clean architecture flow for a MERN thrift marketplace”

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately 90%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
